Description: The 'Apache' 'PDFBox' library is an open source 'Java' tools for working 
    with Portable Document Format ('PDF') documents. This project allows creation of new 
    'PDF' documents, manipulation of existing documents and the ability to extract content
    from documents. This is a thin wrapper around some 'PDFBox' capabilities.
